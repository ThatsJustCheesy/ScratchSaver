# ScratchSaver

A modified version of _WebSaver_: A Mac screen saver that shows a single webpage.

ScratchSaver allows you to use a Scratch project as a screen saver… if you've ever wanted to do that. Paste the "embed" URL (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/&lt;projectid>/embed) into the WebSaver preferences window within in System Preferences; ScratchSaver auto-clicks the green flag button after a short delay when the project page loads.

Builds in Xcode. Output is ScratchSaver.saver, which Finder sees as a screensaver file.
